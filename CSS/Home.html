              India's brilliant win against Sri Lanka
          </header>

          <p>India's young guns will get another opportunity to flaunt their exceptional talent and secure a series win against a hapless Sri Lankan outfit in the second ODI, in Colombo, on Tuesday.

Skipper Shikhar Dhawan was left in complete awe at the other end as the likes of Prithvi Shaw, Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav made batting look ridiculously easy in the first ODI on Sunday night.

In the long run, India want to play more aggressively in the shorter formats and the performance of the trio served as a perfect template in that context.

Their sensational batting also reinforced the might of India's bench strength with ODI debutants Kishan and Yadav bossing the opposition from ball one.

Sri Lanka bowlers also made it easier for the marauding Indian batters who romped home to the win in the 37th over.
